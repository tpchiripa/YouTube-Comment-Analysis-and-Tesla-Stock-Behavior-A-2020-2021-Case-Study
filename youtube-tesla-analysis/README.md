YouTube Comment Analysis and Tesla Stock Behavior (2020–2021)
Overview
This project explores the relationship between public attention on YouTube and Tesla’s stock price performance from 2020 to 2021. By extracting and analyzing keyword mentions related to Tesla from prominent YouTube channels, we tracked how online discourse fluctuated over time and compared it with Tesla’s adjusted closing stock price.

Key Insights
Temporal alignment: Spikes in keyword mentions often coincided with significant Tesla stock price movements.

Notable period: In October 2020, a surge in online attention was closely followed by a rapid stock price increase, likely driven by product announcements or earnings reports.

2021 trends: While public attention remained high, price reactions were less pronounced, hinting at market saturation or reduced sensitivity to repeated news cycles.
